# Generative AI Chatbot with Ollama, Docker Compose, and Web Search Integration

This repository contains a chatbot application powered by Generative AI models using Ollama. The chatbot is enhanced with real-time context fetching from the internet via the DuckDuckGo Web Search API, allowing it to provide up-to-date and relevant responses based on user queries. The project features a containerized setup with Docker Compose for easy deployment and management of multiple services.
